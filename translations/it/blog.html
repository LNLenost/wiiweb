        Ciao a tutti da fin! Oggi (per me il 3 Giugno 2024) rilasciamo la versione 24m06a. Ecco i cambiamenti e le novità in arrivo.
Post

Eccoli qui, i post! Questi non hanno a che fare con quelli del Canale Wii Shop (o avvisi importanti) poichè ci stiamo ancora lavorando. Admins can now make posts on the website to inform those who don't follow our social medias but check our website with news about security updates and more. There are still some bugs to fix, and posts will be in English only, so you might need to use Google Translate or similar tools.
Wii Support for the Website
        
Ever wanted to check the website on your Wii? No? Well, now you can! Sort of. It's still in development, so you might not find much yet, but just give us a few more days and almost the entire website will be functional. Some pages like "Wallpapers" will not have a download button, so it would just be a gallery. You can visit it at wii.ftolnks.xyz.
New Translation System
        
I thought it would be a good idea to remake the translation system, but it resulted in many errors, so I decided to schedule it for later. This update could add faster text loading and make it easier adding new languages. Another upcoming feature is translation statistics, which will show how much of the website is translated in a specific language (e.g. Turkish at 66.67% and Italian at 100%). However, there was an issue where the statistics incorrectly found untranslated strings, like if the Italian and English translations matched, which I’ll need to fix later.
That is all. We are the New Shop Channel.
